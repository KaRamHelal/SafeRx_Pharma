## Overview

The [SafeRx Developer Portal](https://saferx.online/developer.html) provides self-service access to the Drug Safety API. Register, verify your email, and receive a free API key in minutes.

## Registration Flow

```
Register → Email Verification → Free Key → Build & Test → Request Production Key
```

### 1. Register

```bash
curl -X POST https://saferx.online/api/developers/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "dev@yourcompany.com",
    "password": "your_secure_password",
    "org_name": "Your Company"
  }'
```

A 6-digit verification code is sent to your email.

### 2. Verify Email

```bash
curl -X POST https://saferx.online/api/developers/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "dev@yourcompany.com",
    "code": "123456"
  }'
```

On success, you receive:
- A **free-tier API key** (`sk_test_...`)
- A **JWT token** for portal access (24h expiry)

### 3. Login

```bash
curl -X POST https://saferx.online/api/developers/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "dev@yourcompany.com",
    "password": "your_secure_password"
  }'
```

Returns a JWT token. Use it in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all authenticated endpoints.

## Key Management

### List Keys

```bash
curl https://saferx.online/api/developers/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

### Rotate a Key

Generate a new key value for an existing key (the old value stops working immediately):

```bash
curl -X POST https://saferx.online/api/developers/keys/{key_id}/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

### Revoke a Key

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://saferx.online/api/developers/keys/{key_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

## Key Types

| Prefix | Tier | How to Get |
|--------|------|------------|
| `sk_test_` | Free | Automatic on email verification |
| `sk_live_` | Pro / Enterprise | Request via portal (admin review) |

Free-tier keys have rate limits of 20 req/min and 60 req/day, with access to the full database (28,557 products).

## Usage Statistics

```bash
curl https://saferx.online/api/developers/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```
