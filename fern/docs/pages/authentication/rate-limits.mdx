## Tier Limits

| Limit | Free | Professional | Enterprise |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| Per minute | 20 | 60 | Custom |
| Per day | 60 | 500 | Custom |
| Max drugs / request | 20 | 20 | 50 |
| Max unique drugs / day | 200 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Auth method | Session token | API key | API key |
| Tracked by | IP address | API key | API key |
| SLA | Best-effort | 99.9% uptime | 99.99% + BAA |
| Support | Email | Priority email | Dedicated + Slack |

## Rate Limit Headers

Responses include rate limit headers for clients subject to rate limiting:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute` | Requests remaining in the current minute window |
| `X-RateLimit-Tier` | Your current tier (`free`, `pro`, `enterprise`) |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait (only on 429 responses) |

<Note>
`X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute` and `X-RateLimit-Tier` are only included for non-whitelisted IPs. If your IP is whitelisted (e.g., internal services), these headers may not be present. Do not rely on their presence for application logic — use them for observability only.
</Note>

## 429 Responses

### Per-Minute Limit Exceeded

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "limit_per_minute": 20,
  "requests_this_minute": 21,
  "tier": "free",
  "hint": "Upgrade to Pro for higher limits. Contact support@saferx.online",
  "support": "support@saferx.online"
}
```

### Daily Limit Exceeded

```json
{
  "error": "You have exceeded your daily limit",
  "daily_limit": 60,
  "requests_today": 61,
  "tier": "free",
  "hint": "Upgrade to Pro for 500 requests/day. Contact support@saferx.online",
  "support": "support@saferx.online"
}
```

## Retry Strategy

Use exponential backoff with jitter when you receive a 429 response:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    import httpx
    import time
    import random

    def call_with_retry(url, headers, body, max_retries=3):
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            resp = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=body)

            if resp.status_code == 429:
                retry_after = int(resp.headers.get("Retry-After", 60))
                jitter = random.uniform(0, retry_after * 0.1)
                wait = retry_after + jitter
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait:.1f}s (attempt {attempt + 1})")
                time.sleep(wait)
                continue

            return resp

        raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    async function callWithRetry(
      url: string,
      headers: Record<string, string>,
      body: object,
      maxRetries = 3,
    ): Promise<Response> {
      for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
        const resp = await fetch(url, {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { ...headers, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify(body),
        });

        if (resp.status === 429) {
          const retryAfter = parseInt(resp.headers.get("Retry-After") ?? "60");
          const jitter = Math.random() * retryAfter * 0.1;
          const wait = retryAfter + jitter;
          console.log(`Rate limited. Waiting ${wait.toFixed(1)}s (attempt ${attempt + 1})`);
          await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, wait * 1000));
          continue;
        }

        return resp;
      }

      throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

## Abuse Protection

The API includes automated abuse detection that may temporarily block access if unusual request patterns are detected. Checks are tier-aware — Free tier has stricter protections, while Enterprise tier is the most permissive.

| Tier | Block Duration | Behavior |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Free | Up to 24 hours | Automated checks active |
| Pro | Up to 1 hour | Relaxed checks |
| Enterprise | No auto-block | Manual review only |

### 403 Block Response

```json
{
  "error": "Access denied",
  "reason": "suspicious_activity",
  "message": "Your access has been temporarily suspended due to unusual request patterns.",
  "support": "support@saferx.online"
}
```

### Best Practices

- Always include a `User-Agent` header identifying your application
- Cache results client-side to avoid redundant requests
- Use reasonable request spacing appropriate for your use case

If you are blocked and believe it is in error, contact support@saferx.online.

## Daily Limit Reset

Daily limits use a rolling 24-hour window, not calendar day. The window starts from your first request of the period.

## Upgrading

Contact support@saferx.online to upgrade your tier:
- **Professional** — 500 requests/day, API key auth, relaxed anti-scraping
- **Enterprise** — Custom limits, dedicated support, no auto-blocking
