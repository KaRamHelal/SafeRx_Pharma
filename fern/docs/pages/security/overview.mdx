subtitle: How SafeRx protects your data and ensures API integrity
---

## Architecture

The SafeRx Drug Safety API runs on a hardened infrastructure stack:

- **TLS 1.2+** on all connections — no plaintext HTTP
- **Docker isolation** — API and database run in separate containers
- **Nginx reverse proxy** — request filtering, rate limiting, and DDoS mitigation
- **Redis-backed rate limiting** — per-minute and per-day windows
- **Anti-scraping heuristics** — 6 behavioral checks with automatic blocking

## Authentication Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| API key | `X-SafeRx-API-Key` | Identifies the caller and determines tier |
| Anti-scraping | Automatic | 6 behavioral heuristics block abuse |
| Rate limiting | Redis-backed | Per-minute and per-day windows per key |
| User-Agent check | Automatic | Blocks automated scraping tools |

## Data Handling

### What We Receive

- Drug names (trade or generic)
- Patient population/condition context (no PII)
- Request metadata (IP, User-Agent, timestamp)

### What We Do NOT Receive or Store

- Patient names, IDs, or demographic data
- Prescription numbers or medical record numbers
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Identifier Stripping

The transformation layer strips all internal database identifiers before returning responses. No internal IDs (database keys, external reference codes) are ever exposed to API consumers.

## Audit Trail

Request metadata is logged to Redis with a 24-hour TTL for abuse detection:

- Timestamp, IP address, User-Agent
- Drug count and domain requests
- Tier and API key presence (not the key itself)

After 24 hours, audit data is automatically purged.

## Anti-Scraping Protection

Six heuristic checks detect and block automated data extraction attempts. See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/authentication/rate-limits) for details on which checks apply to each tier.
