## Changed (2026-02-16)

- **`name` → `effect_name`** in adverse effect objects — the `name` field in `severe` and `common` effect arrays is now `effect_name`. This applies to B2B responses, OpenAPI specs, and SDK-generated types. No backward-compatibility alias is provided since no external B2B clients are in production.

## Added

- **Unified Drug Safety Check** (`POST /api/drug_safety/check`) — screen 1-20 drugs across 6 safety domains in a single request
- **API Metadata** (`GET /api/drug_safety/metadata`) — discover available populations, conditions, risk scales, and database versions
- **Six safety domains:**
  - Adverse effects with Black Box Warnings, monitoring, and dose classification
  - Drug-drug interactions (337K+ pairs) with severity scoring
  - Pregnancy & lactation risk ratings (0-7 scale, 24,512 products)
  - Food-drug interactions (38K+ interactions) with meal timing
  - Clinical considerations for 5 populations and 14 conditions
  - Dosing safety (dual-source, 19K+ products)
- **Smart drug resolution** — fuzzy name matching for 28,557 Egyptian pharmaceutical products
- **Alert bubbling** — critical safety issues surfaced as top-level alerts sorted by severity
- **Bilingual support** — English and Arabic for rationale text, drug names, and clinical advice
- **Stable API contract** — public field names are versioned and will not change without notice
- **3-tier rate limiting** — Free (20/min, 60/day), Professional (60/min, 500/day), Enterprise (custom)
- **Abuse protection** — automated checks with tier-aware enforcement
- **Request integrity** — API key authentication with User-Agent validation

## Security

- No internal database identifiers exposed in API responses
- Audit log retention with automatic purge
- API key validation with tier-based access control
