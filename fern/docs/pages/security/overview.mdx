subtitle: How SafeRx protects your data and ensures API integrity
---

## Architecture

The SafeRx Drug Safety API runs on a hardened infrastructure stack:

- **TLS 1.2+** on all connections — no plaintext HTTP
- **Container isolation** — API and database run in separate isolated environments
- **Reverse proxy** — request filtering, rate limiting, and DDoS mitigation
- **Rate limiting** — per-minute and per-day windows with standard headers

## Authentication Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| API key | `X-SafeRx-API-Key` | Identifies the caller and determines tier |
| Abuse detection | Automatic | Behavioral checks block automated scraping |
| Rate limiting | Per-key | Per-minute and per-day windows |
| User-Agent check | Automatic | Validates request origin |

## Data Handling

### What We Receive

- Drug names (trade or generic)
- Patient population/condition context (no PII)
- Request metadata (IP, User-Agent, timestamp)

### What We Do NOT Receive or Store

- Patient names, IDs, or demographic data
- Prescription numbers or medical record numbers
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Response Integrity

All API responses use stable, versioned public field names. No internal database identifiers or reference codes are ever exposed to API consumers.

## Audit Trail

Request metadata is retained for a limited time for abuse detection:

- Timestamp, IP address, User-Agent
- Drug count and domain requests
- Tier and API key presence (not the key itself)

Audit data is automatically purged after the retention window.

## Abuse Protection

Automated checks detect and block scraping or abuse patterns. These checks are tier-aware — Free tier has stricter protections, Enterprise tier relies on manual review. See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/authentication/rate-limits) for details.
