## Overview

The SafeRx MCP Server wraps the Drug Safety API as a Model Context Protocol server, enabling direct integration with AI tools that support MCP.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `check_drug_safety` | Screen drugs across all safety domains |
| `get_drug_metadata` | Get available populations, conditions, and database versions |

## Installation

```bash
SAFERX_API_KEY=sfx_free_... npx @saferx_pharma/mcp-server
```

An API key is required. [Get a free key](/api-reference/authentication/api-keys) to get started.

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "saferx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@saferx_pharma/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SAFERX_API_KEY": "sfx_free_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

The MCP server is a thin HTTP wrapper:

```
AI Client (Claude/Cursor) → MCP Protocol → SafeRx MCP Server → HTTPS → SafeRx API
```

All authentication, rate limiting, and security is handled by the API layer. The MCP server simply translates MCP tool calls into HTTP requests.
