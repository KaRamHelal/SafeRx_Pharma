## Acceptable Use

The SafeRx Drug Safety API is intended for:

- Clinical decision support in pharmacy and hospital settings
- Drug safety screening in healthcare software
- Health information applications for patients and professionals
- Medical research and academic use
- AI-powered health assistants (with appropriate disclaimers)

## Prohibited Use

The following uses are prohibited:

- **Replacing licensed pharmacist judgment** — the API is a decision support tool, not an autonomous prescribing system
- **Systematic data extraction** — bulk downloading of the drug database is prohibited
- **Resale of raw data** — redistributing API response data without transformation or value-add
- **Misrepresentation** — presenting SafeRx data as your own proprietary database

## Liability

SafeRx provides drug safety information on a "best-effort" basis. While we strive for accuracy:

- Data may not reflect the most recent label changes
- Not all drug products or interactions may be covered
- The API is not a substitute for clinical judgment

SafeRx is not liable for clinical decisions made based on API data. Healthcare providers retain full responsibility for patient care decisions.
